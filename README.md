# Paws & Preferences

A simple, mobile-friendly web app to discover what kind of cats you prefer! Swipe right to like, left to dislike, and see your results at the end.

## Features

- **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe left/right or use buttons to like/dislike cats
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Cat API**: Real cat images from CATAAS API
- **Results Summary**: See all cats you liked at the end
- **Play Again**: Start over with new cats

## How to Use

1. **Open the app** in your web browser
2. **View each cat** that appears
3. **Swipe right** (or click "Like") for cats you like
4. **Swipe left** (or click "Dislike") for cats you don't like

## How It Works

- Uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks)
- Fetches cat images from **CATAAS API**
- Uses **touch/mouse events** for swipe detection
- Stores liked cats in **JavaScript arrays**
- Shows responsive design with **CSS Flexbox/Grid**

## Files

- `index.html` - Main structure of the app
- `style.css` - All styling and responsive design
- `script.js` - All functionality and API calls
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Customization

You can easily change:
- Number of cats (change `TOTAL_CATS` in script.js)
- Colors (edit colors in style.css)
- Styling (modify CSS classes)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Cat images don't load
**Solution**: The app has fallback images that will load instead

**Problem**: Swipe doesn't work on mobile
**Solution**: Use the Like/Dislike buttons instead

**Problem**: Results don't show
**Solution**: Make sure you've gone through all 10 cats
